			from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression	: This is the most frequently used model to predict outcome. 
			from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression	: This model is used when output is binary, means 2 or 1



 1. DecisionTreeClassifier()		: you have to take following steps,

							i.   my_model = DecisionTreeClassifier() : make an object(as my_model) of DTC.
							ii.  my_model.fit(x, y)                 : fit your model by your input and output data.
							iii. y_pred = my_model.predict(x)	: Now you get your prediction data(y_pred) by your model.
